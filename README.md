## Metamask Smart Contract Interaction Starter Template

Welcome to the Metamask Smart Contract Interaction Starter Template! This template provides you with a basic setup to interact with smart contracts using Metamask.

### Instructions

Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/anukulpandey/metamask-contract-interfaction
   ```

2. Install dependencies using yarn:
   ```
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   yarn dev
   ```

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/): Ensure you have Metamask installed in your browser and you have set up an account.

### Getting Started

This starter template provides you with the necessary tools to interact with smart contracts through Metamask. It sets up a development environment with all the required dependencies.

### Usage

1. Edit the smart contract address:
   In the appropriate file, replace `address.jsx` with the actual address of the smart contract you want to interact with.

2. Add your contract's ABI (Application Binary Interface):
   Ensure you have the ABI of your smart contract. Replace `abi.jsx` in the respective file with your actual ABI.

3. Write your interaction code:
   In the designated file, write your JavaScript code to interact with the smart contract. You can call functions, read data, and handle transactions through Metamask.

4. Run your application:
   After setting up the contract address and ABI, and writing your interaction code, run the development server using `yarn dev` and open your application in the browser. Make sure Metamask is connected and configured to the appropriate network.
